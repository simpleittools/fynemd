# FyneMD
This is a simple Markdown Editor. This was my first introduction into Fyne.
Since it is so simple, and I know it doesn't track anything, I started using it as my daily Markdown Editor.
As a result, I decided to compile it for release.

### Release compatability
Release v0.1.0-alpha has only been tested on an Ubuntu 24.04 system running Wayland.  
Future releases will also be tested on Windows 11.
